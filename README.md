# Analyze Sentiment, Key Phrases and Entities of China-US Relations Articles with AWS Translate and Comprehend
This is a project for my studies at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/). The aim is to demonstrate how we can use some of the machine learning tools offered by [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) to do some cool things such as text translation (with [AWS Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/)) and text analytics (with [AWS Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/)) in R.

As China-US relations have been one of the top real-world topics for quite a long time, and I am not an expert on this topic myself, so I would like to take this use case as an opportunity to explore a bit about this topic and try to understand the perspective of Chinese media regarding China-US relations.
